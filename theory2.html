			<h1>WINGS Theory</h1>

     <div class="info">
			<p>This theory is constructed up till #First Love.
I’ll start with the events of today as in the “FIRST LOVe is a LIE ” part and go on from there. My main focus is around the book so if you haven’t read the book then I recommend you do because it all makes so much more sense. 
I don’t know really what to say other than maybe Yoongi and Jimin experienced their First Love already and whilst Yoongi got out of his first love with a slightly cynical/angry view towards the world , Jimin got in a mental trauma or has problems such as depression.

I still think that Jungkook got hit by a car as shown in INU, Run, and the Begin teaser with the noise and broken glass. In the book Demian tells Sinclair that  “The bird rights its way out of the egg. The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God’s name is Abraxas. “  I think he is in some sort of coma after the accident, after life or in some point that allowed him to break his egg and destroy his world so he can reach Abraxas.( There is his shadow of a flying bird so think he did manage that)  Thus allowing him to help both Yoongi and Jimin. 

He is helping Yoongi by calling onto his own Sinclair, using Kromer’s triggering whistle to alert him of danger, making him run from the shop in search for the voice or trying to run from it. I as well think that same power that brought Sinclair to Demian is used here to save Yoongi from that car’s way or he is simply mixing up worlds/ relives Jungkook’s emotions.The appearance of Jimin’s bathtub in First Love might  actually show how Jimin as well feels the calling and is about to get out of the water and clearly survive. 

Now onto Jimin’s side of the story I think he represents Abel, the one who lives in the light, under a spell just like Sinclair thought back when he was with his family, terrorized by Kromer. He is living in the light world yet does not feel a part of it and instead is just suffocated by it, thus leading him to attempt suicide.
Taehyung is the Cain of the story. The one who lives in the dark side of the world under a stigma of crime,dirty and evil, fighting his way through the darkness but failing. I think we’ll see in the future teasers some other member being called on by Taehyung’s mark. </p>

<h2>We can see how their solos "First Love" and "Lie" are connected. If they write songs about each other it means that they had/have something, they're not gonna fool us anymore, they are actually dating in secret, but their agency keep them in the closet, i mean if their agency doesn't even let them have a heterosexual relationsip, what make us think that they would be out of the closet that easy? Exactly, becuse South Korea is still a conservative society</h2>
