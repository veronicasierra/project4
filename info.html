 <h1>What is Yoonmin?</h1>
 <h2>YoonMin (Yoon/gi and Ji/min) is the friendship pairing between Suga and Jimin. A popular ship with fans, but rather subtle in nature.
And I’m gonna proof that they are actually dating in secret but they don’t let anybody know since Korea is a conservative society.</h2>

<h1>They Are together but they hide it!</h1>
<p>They are both in the band BTS.</p>
<p>During The 3rd Muster, they sang together Tony Montana.</p>
<p>In Run BTS Episode 29, Yoongi chose Jimin as one of his partners.</p>
<p>In Run BTS Episode 46, Yoongi had to make a cup for Jimin, and engraved it with 'Jimin ♡'.</p>
