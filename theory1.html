 <p>First off Important Themes To Remember:</p>

<p>1. Colours (To me)</p>

<p>White- Jimin</p>

<p>Blue- Suga</p>

<p>Yellow- Their Love</p>

<p>People have already talked about the blue mould thing. It ties with Suga’s hair and the yellow is the colour of their relationship as they both agreed in that interview. I also think Jimin was very angelic and pure in the eyes of a lot of people so white makes sense.</p>

<p>2. Sun/ Moon- Eclipse:</p>

<p>Sun-Jimin</p>

<p>Moon- Suga</p>

<p>Eclipse- When they come together (Romantic entanglement.)</p>

<p>It makes sense. Jimin is bright and smiley and warm. Yoongi is cold mysterious but a guiding light in the darkest of times.</p>

<p>3. its just interesting to think about and it actually makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Okay now lets break this down!</p>

“All this is no coincidence”

<p>Poetry, lyrical, prose or script. NOTHING IS a coincidence. Everything in art is there for a reason. Even more interesting is the scene set as Jimin sings this line:</p>
 <center><img src="images/jimin2.jpg"width="50%" height="30%"></center>
 <p>This image is no coincidence. Keep in mind the themes. He is in white. And behind him is a bright white light. He has pushed himself into to background and surrounded himself in Yoongi’s aura. Either that, or he feels to love Yoongi, he has to discard his old self in order to make him happy. Even his body is painted blue.</p>

<p>He is holding onto a blanket. A yellow blanket. He is holding onto their love as a comfort blanket. I think during one of his dark times he turned to Yoongi and is using him as a crutch.  He’s lost himself and clinging to Yoongi to keep afloat. He doesn’t feel like his old self and so he is scared. The light behind him is representing a new future him, but his back is to it. He is scared of how different this all feels. Which brings me to:</p>
“ Just-Just- That I could feel, The whole word is different than yesterday.”

<p>This, to me, means two or three things. I think it was sudden and very passionate. I think he feels different in himself and also the two moods are different.

I think the day after they both weren’t sure what to make of what happened. I think it the chemistry and the love was bubbling and smouldering for a while but suddenly they were confirming it in bed.

I think he scared that he feels different in himself AND that it doesn’t feel like yesterday, it’s like the silence after an earthquake. It probably feels like a ghost of a memory for Jimin, like a dream and it haunts him because, in the first scene he is in the afterglow and everything is Yoongi and Yoonmin.

And maybe Suga is confused too and we all know how little he likes to talk. Maybe the fact he doesn’t acknowledge it, worries Jimin more and it makes Jimin feel like Yoongi has rejected him or used him. Like maybe last night didn’t mean to him what it meant to Jimin. Lets look at the images that go with it for back up:</p>
 <center><img src="images/jimin3.jpg"width="50%" height="30%"></center>
 <p>We see Jimin disappear into a bed. Disappear into himself (white). The memory of last night is now tainted and he feels alone in his feelings. So he hides their intimacy away in his own head. He buried himself back in that bed alone because he wants to stay there, drown in that beautiful past feeling, even though it scares him.</p>
 <center><img src="images/cactus.jpg"width="50%" height="30%"></center>
 <p>The remnants of their love and joy are prickly. They are something, Jimin is certain in his mind, that  will hurt him if he touches them again. But here Suga is represented just out of frame as a little blurry blue circle. Suga is there maybe he is talking to him, but not about what happened, so he’s near but he’s barely there. He calls to Jimin and Jimin is drawn to him because of the intense joy he felt between them last night. 

Now, lets look at the symbolism of a cactus. Cacti are prickly, like Yoongi. They also grow flowers. Indoor cacti like this only bloom under sunlight. Therefor, Suga only blooms (like last night) in Jimin’s presence.

But he will not let Jimin too near. This is the cactus between them, the prickly exterior.

However because Jim is Jimin and Jimin will bloom (open up) enough for the both of them because he wants to see Suga like he was last night. Free and bright.</p>

  <h2>Definately this song is about Yoongi, Jimin clearly expresses his feelings for Yoongi through this song. Yoongi does the same thing through his songs too, which shows how real Yoonmin can be, some people say that the strongest feelings can be expressed through music and in Serendipity you can hear all the love and affection through Jimin's voice. As i said before Yellow represents their love, so we can notice that the whole music video has yellow on it, so that proofs something, Jimin is practically screaming "I'M DATING YOONGI!"</h2>
